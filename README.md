Google released a Colab notebook demonstrating use of Gemini Pro to create customized Christmas wishes using the details of recipients from Google Spreadsheets.

In this Colab notebook I used Google's Gemini Pro to write different stories around different themes in differnt styles.

You will need to create your Google API Key for this project. It is free and easy to get one, just go to Makersuite (https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey) and create one.

Your API key is like your password, do not share it with others, do not put it openly in publicly shared Colab notebooks or Jupyter Notebooks.

You will need to grant Colab access to your Spreadsheets app in Google Drive for this project.
